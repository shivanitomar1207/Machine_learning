# What is ML , AI deep neural network......

Now we understand, how does a machine can be intelligent.....

In a normal computer programming, we used to do tell computer what to do by giving normal instruction like if i == 0 than do this else do that. Now imagine a computer become intelligent
by finding out what to do and what not to do. How this is possible..... yes it is possible...  

Now think how we human learn. yes , by experinces which are most precious things in the world. Now imagine if I do collect all experiences and train computer, then it will be intelligent like us.

All these things are very upper level and we all are technical person and believe intechnology.

Now, lets take and example of generative models. Guys actually, now I am studying generative model with images so I will give examples of generative models. 

Suppose, I have a picture and I want to color it, what will be my planning. My planning will be find out the boundry color which I suppose is black and color those images. In computer
it is done by recursive flodd fill algorithm. In normal, we instruct computer that upper left is blue the find out black boundries and store it into an array and have array of colors.
and do coloring using computer.

Now I want, computer to identify color on its own. What I will do, I will give same multiple images and tell computer to find out the color on its own. now question is how a computer 
find out its boundries, there comes concept of neural network.

neural netowrk in derived from human brain. now, you have seen shopkeeper weighing suger. it constantly checks output of weighing machine and put suger accordingly by taking out and 
in suger from suger bag. Same thing computer does. It knows the output already just plus and minus the from the weights to calculate them.

If I do talk about a single neuron, it is done by adding and subtracting the delta weights to the current weight. it is simple, so adding and subtratcing is succificent.

now imagine neural network with multiple neurons and layers. what to do. Even we don't know the weights of each neuron. how to calculate these weights.

Here comes algebra. you know what how we calculate the value of x. now imagine every weight is w1 ....... wn. due to adding layers , we multiply everything, so that means integraing.

guys lets me tell you guys...... addition , multiplication and integrations are same just differnce of level. it it is simple than we do addition, to fast up the process wesaid multiply
but actually processor level we are only adding the value. line 3*5 = adding 3, 5 times. if we talk in terms of algebra, adding is intergration. because we always increase power by one.
basic rule.
and power increament is multiplicationand multiplication means adding.

and subtraction, division and differenciation is same. just diffenrce of levels.
bye guys, I need to go as it bhai dauj today....... and I need to do this... will meet you another day or another time.
